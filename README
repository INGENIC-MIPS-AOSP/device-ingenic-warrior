Put all files under me to $ANDROID_ROOT/device/ingenic/warrior/

****PART ONE: Building the System****
1. Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script.
    $ source build/envsetup.sh
or
    $ . build/envsetup.sh

2. Choose target.
    $ lunch full_warrior-userdebug

3. Build everything.
    $ make -j24

****PART TWO: Flashing the device****
Because fastboot is related to bootloader, so x-boot-nand.bin must be updated first.
NOTICE: For updating x-boot-nand.bin by TF card, we ONLY support TF card of 2G and 8G.

----updating x-boot----
Flash the TF card(Only need doing this once):
   a. Insert a 2G or 8G TF card into PC;
   b. $ cd device/ingenic/warrior/burner;
   c. Run burn.sh followed the path of your TF card as argument. For example: sudo ./burn.sh /dev/sdc. Be careful of the device node, this step will format the TF card !!!
   d. Eject the TF card and reinsert into PC;
   e. cp config.txt /media/XXX/;
   f. cp burning_list_forxboot.txt /media/XXX/burning_list.txt;
   g. cp x-boot-nand.bin /media/XXX;
   h. Unmount it;
   i. Insert the TF card into device;
   j. Press vol- and do a reset.
NOTICE: Keeping vol- pressed until seeing the boot logo(A green Android robot).

----Flashing with FASTBOOT----
1. Run:
   $ cd 'Android-root'
   $ sudo -s
   # . build/envsetup.sh
   # lunch full_warrior-userdebug
   # ./fastboot flashall
NOTE: Because of the system is resized to 640MB, flashall will take about 10 Minutes.

2. Press 'esc' and do a reset;
NOTICE: Keeping 'esc' pressed until seeing the fastboot logo(A green Android robot and a few words).
